# Workshop Documentation

## Prerequisites
Workshop users must have the following prerequisites in order to successfully complete the workshop:
- Ability to modify code on GitHub
- Accessing the Workshop Account
    - Accept the email invite you receive from the Workshop account.
    - Verify you are in the correct account under Account Settings (your instructor will provide the account name)
    - This step should be unnecessary. But if your email address is associated with other existing Harness accounts and you end up in a different account by mistake, this will take you back to the workshop account.

## Username Selection
Choose a username and use that across the entire lab where you see `<username>`.
- Alpha characters only, no special characters or spaces.

## Lab 1 - Add a Service Component
### Summary
Configure a service component and associate it with a team, and create a dependency.

### Learning Objective(s):
- Defining a service component
- Defining relationships and attributes in a service component
- Browsing different aspects of a component in the UI and YAML

### Part 1: Create a component
1. Login to GitHub.
2. Clone down or access the `slb-idp-lab` repository in the terminal. We will be working on the main branch.
3. Create a new `core-backend` component YAML via the terminal (or GitHub file editor).
4. Copy the contents of the `components/core-backend.yaml`.
5. Create a new file in the `components` directory and title it `core-backend-<username>.yaml`.
    - E.g., My new file location would be `components/core-backend-cassie.yaml`.
6. Create a new `core api` YAML.
7. Copy the contents of the `apis/core-api.yaml`.
8. Create a new file in the `components` directory and title it `core-api-<username>.yaml`.
    - E.g., My new file location would be `apis/core-api-cassie.yaml`.
9. Modify the file fields below in the `components/core-backend.yaml` and the `apis/core-api.yaml` you just made:
    ```yaml
    # Yaml location
    # Original Value: core-backend-<input username>
    # New Value: core-backend-cassie
    metadata:
      name: core-backend-cassie

    # Original Value: - sample - core
    # New Value: - sample - core - cassie
    tags:
      - sample
      - core
      - cassie
    ```
10. Save the changes in your repository.

### Part 2: Register 2 components in Harness
1. Open Harness in a new browser tab.
2. On the left-hand menu, click on ‚ÄúDeveloper Portal‚Äù.
3. On the left-hand sub-menu, click on ‚ÄúRegister‚Äù.
4. In the URL field, add your `core-api-<username>.yaml` location.
    - Example: [https://github.com/harnessworkshop/slb-idp-lab/blob/main/components/core-backend.yaml](https://github.com/harnessworkshop/slb-idp-lab/blob/main/components/core-backend.yaml)
5. Click Analyze, then Click Import.
6. Upon success, click ‚ÄúView Component‚Äù.
7. Repeat steps 3-6 for your `core-backend-<username>.yaml`.

### Part 3: Review components 
With your component from the previous exercise, review various aspects of the component.
- Example component view:
    - With your dependent component open.
    - In the Relations widget: Note that the component is owned by platformteam (group) and is dependent on your first service component.
    - Click on your first component (this will move you into the component).
    - Take note of links, source, etc., that were defined in your component showing up in the UI.
    - Click on the CI/CD, Scorecard, and API tabs.

## Lab 2 - Add CI/CD
### Summary
Configure pipeline relationship.

### Learning Objective(s):
- Link Harness CI/CD results to your registered component
- Documentation for the ADO plugin

### Part 1: Add CI/CD and project details to a component
1. Open your `components/core-backend.yaml` file and add the following under annotations:
    ```yaml
    annotations:
      backstage.io/techdocs-ref: dir:.
      harness.io/project-url: [https://app.harness.io/ng/account/yQvtq8usTqy7F9FkPQgmEA/home/orgs/default/projects/IDP_Workshop/details](https://app.harness.io/ng/account/yQvtq8usTqy7F9FkPQgmEA/home/orgs/default/projects/IDP_Workshop/details)
      harness.io/cd-serviceId: corebackend
    ```
2. Save the file changes.
3. In Harness, open your component and click on the refresh button on the right side of the ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù section.
4. You will see a message that refresh is scheduled. This should take 1-30 seconds.
5. Click on the CI/CD tab.
6. You will see a list of deployments for the associated service.

## Lab 3 - Scorecards

### Summary
Configure scorecard and weights.

### Learning Objective(s)
- Configure a scorecard.

### Part 1: Create a scorecard
1. Go to the "Scorecards" tab under "Admin" and Create New Scorecard.
2. Add the name `<your-username>` as the Name field.
3. Add ‚Äúplatformteam‚Äù as the ‚ÄúOwner‚Äù.
4. Add ‚Äú<your-username>‚Äù under tags (should auto-populate).
5. Under ‚ÄúAdd Checks to Scorecard‚Äù on the right, select for following:
    - Spec owner exists
    - Tech Docs exists
    - Deployed within last 7 days
6. Click ‚ÄúPublish Scorecard‚Äù.

### Part 2: Review scorecard
1. Navigate to one of your services.
2. Your scorecard should appear with a grade of 75.
3. If more than one scorecard is appearing, give your colleagues the side-eye for misconfiguration of their filters.
4. If the sample scorecard is still present, turn that side-eye inward and request help from the instructor to validate your scorecard‚Äôs filters üôÇ.
5. Click into the scorecard tab to see what checks passed and failed, detailing out your score.

### Part 3: Change the criteria
Let‚Äôs change the grading standards.
1. Navigate to the scorecards under admin, and open your scorecard for editing.
2. Toggle ‚ÄúAdjust Weights‚Äù on the right-hand side.
3. Adjust weights to the following:
    - 50 to Spec owner exists
    - 25 to Tech Docs exists
    - 25 to Deploy within last 7 days
4. Click update scorecard.
5. Review your service‚Äôs new score.

Congratulations on your passing grade!
